# Monty Hall Experimental Solver
* This program is built exclusively with standard libraries, hence all you need to do is install python3 and hey presto it works.
* Command line args for bot_sim:
` filename num_doors num_iters num_epochs
* user_sim is run without any command line args, as it takes user input.
